Slide contents.  Yay.

## Another slide

Things I like:

- Markdown
- Haskell
- Pandoc

## A slide with a table

Here's a table:

| Heading 1 | Longer heading 2 | Hdg 3 |
| --- | :---: | ---: |
| Item 1 | a fairly long, centered string | 23 |
| Item 2 | also centered | 161003 |

## More lists

- This list
- is displayed

    * item
    * by item

- Or sometimes

    > * all at
    > * once

## A slide with code on it
[comment]: # This is a comment

This is *emph text*

This is **bold text**

This is `code text`

Here is a code block:

    another line of code
